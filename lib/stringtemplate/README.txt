ST (StringTemplate) is a java template engine (with ports for C# and Python) for generating source code, web pages, emails, or any other formatted text output. ST is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators, multiple site skins, and internationalization/localization. It evolved over years of effort developing jGuru.com. ST also generates this website and powers the ANTLR v3 code generator. Its distinguishing characteristic is that it strictly enforces model-view separation unlike other engines.

The main website is:

	http://www.stringtemplate.org

The documentation is in the wiki:
